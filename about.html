        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In the West, there has been a notable increase in stand-replacing fires as mean and maximum fire size and annually burned area have 
            dramatically increased since the 1980s (Miller et al. 2009). During 1972 – 2018 California experienced a fivefold increase in annual burned area, 
            this increase was primarily supported from an eightfold increase in summer forest-fire extent (Williams et al. 2019). Our goal is to develop a website that visualizes 
            historical fire ignitions in California of large fire events (1000 acres or more) and predicts fire ignition for the rest of 2023 using machine learning techniques. 
            To project ignitions, we will use various environmental variables, including monthly maximum, minimum, and average temperature, historical fire shapes, 
            elevation, aspect, slope, precipitation, and maximum and minimum vapor pressure to train our machine learning model. After the model is trained the resulting 
            ignitions will then be presented on our web map. The website will provide users with an interactive platform to explore past wildfires and the climatic affects present at 
            time the month of ignition, enabling an understanding of the environmental conditions leading to fire ignition, and help prepare for future fires of 2023. Our goal is to 
            develop a tool that can assist in fire management and prevention, ultimately reducing the damage caused by wildfires.</p>
